  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m an MBA graduate who loves turning ideas into something real that makes a difference. Over the years, I’ve learned that innovation isn’t just about chasing the next big thing — it’s about finding smart, practical ways to help businesses grow and stay ahead. I’m naturally curious, always looking for better solutions, and I enjoy working side by side with teams to make change happen. I focus on building systems and strategies that don’t just create short-term wins, but keep a business consistent, steady, and strong over time. Whether it’s improving a process, launching a new idea, or spotting an opportunity others might miss, I bring both strategy and creativity to the table. For me, the real win is seeing a company not just succeed today, but build the kind of momentum that keeps it thriving in the future.
